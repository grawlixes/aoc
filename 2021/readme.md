# 2021

This is probably my last year going for leaderboard, as I'll (hopefully?) be in the office by this time next year, which means less sleeping in. I'll probably use AOC as an excuse to learn a new functional language next year instead. So I'm trying to make it count by getting great scores this year!

I am participating in three private leaderboards - one is from The Programmer's Hangout, which I got 3rd place in last year. The other two are from Amazon. If you're interested, you can join me in my own private leaderboard with this code: 452473-87ae0ee2
